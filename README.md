My Personal Website

This is my second homework assignment for UNC Chapel Hill's Coding Bootcamp.
This will be my portfolio.

You will find the index.html page is my About Me.

There are also links to my Portfolio page and my Contact page.

I will continue to update this website as I build my portfolio.

Thank you for visiting!
